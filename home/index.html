<h3>About Shellac</h3>
<p>
Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells.  
Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands
and an evaluation function.  Shellac supports multiple shell backends,
including a 'basic' backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and
a full featured 'readline' backend based on the the Haskell readline
bindings found in the standard libraries.
</p>

<p>
This library attempts to allow users to write shells in a declarative
way and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available from a
powerful line editing package like readline.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Currently, the API documentation is the only formal documentation that
exists for Shellac.  It can be viewed from the Hackage main page
or built locally from the source tarball.
</p>
<p>
To see examples of using Shellac, you can check out
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/LambdaShell">the lambda shell,</a>
which I wrote partially as a way to exercise most of Shellac's features.
For a more mimimal example, check out Andy Gimblett's blog, where he shows
<a href="http://gimbo.org.uk/blog/2009/09/15/a-haskell-shell-for-computing-musical-scales-in-58-lines-of-code/"
>how to build a simple shell using Shellac</a> in about 130 (commented!) lines of code.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Shellac is available under a BSD3 license.  See the
<a href="../LICENSE">LICENSE</a> file for details.
</p>

<p>
Be aware, however, that the GNU readline library itself is
licensed under the GPL.  If you wish to use the readline bindings,
your project will need to be GPL compatible.  Also note that the
"compatline" backend may be compiled against readline depending
on the configuration of the target machine.  Your project should be
GPL compatible if you use the compatline backend!
</p>

<p>
Go to the
<a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">readline home page</a>
for more information about the readline library.
</p>

<h3>About portability</h3>
<p>
Currently, Shellac is GHC only.  The 0.5 release made significant
efforts toward portability by eliminating dependencies on the GHC
specific features GADTs and STM.  However, it still requires
existential types, multi-parameter type classes, functional
dependencies, preemptive concurrency support and the FFI.  Currently no
Haskell implementation other than GHC supports all these features.
