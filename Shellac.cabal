Synopsis:       A framework for creating shell environments
Homepage:       http://rwd.rdockins.name/shellac/home/
Description:
  Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells.
  Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands
  and an evaluation function.  Shellac supports multiple shell backends,
  including a 'basic' backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and
  a full featured 'readline' backend based on the the Haskell readline
  bindings found in the standard libraries.
  This library attempts to allow users to write shells at a high level
  and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available from a
  powerful line editing package like readline.
